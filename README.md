criteria work:  
1)  UML design diagrams and associated documentation for the whole Album management system.  
2)  GUI Design and Implementation:
GUI layout, choice of AWT/SWING components, GUI test.
3)  Programming
4)  Testing
5)  Evaluation and Discussion
6)  Documentation

 the functions of the system as follows 
(1) loading an album collection file into the system.

(5) being able to play/stop some music (mp3 file) chosen form the available tracks of an album or a playlist. 

	•	Testing: 
 programs, GUI implementation and document testing. 
 generate a deployable jar file for the system package. 

	•	Report:
 a technical report is available upon request.

* develop a system 
built, based on the programs (classes).
 a graphical user interface (GUI) to provide the following functions or interactions for users: 
For Albums: 
(1) To provide a graphical dialog interface for users to open and load a collection(list) of albums (one or many albums) in a text file provided by other systems into your system, and either to merge with an existing list (if available) or to become a new list.
