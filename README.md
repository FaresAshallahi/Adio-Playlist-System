criteria work:  
1)  UML design diagrams and associated documentation for the whole Album management system.  
2)  GUI Design and Implementation:
GUI layout, choice of AWT/SWING components, GUI test.
3)  Programming
4)  Testing
5)  Evaluation and Discussion
6)  Documentation

 the functions of the system as following: <br> 
(1) loading an album collection file into the system. <br>

(5) being able to play/stop some music (mp3 file) chosen form the available tracks of an album or a playlist. 

	•	Testing: 
 programs, GUI implementation and document testing. 
 generate a deployable jar file for the system package. 

	•	Report:
 a technical report is available upon request.


develop a system:  <br>
built, based on the programs (classes). <br>
 a graphical user interface (GUI) to provide the following functions or interactions for users:  <br>
For Albums:  <br>
(1) To provide a graphical dialog interface for users to open and load a collection(list) of albums (one or many albums) in a text file provided by other systems into your system, and either to merge with an existing list (if available) or to become a new list. <br>

(d) the list of the tracks (title and duration)   <br>
(e) the total duration of the album  <br>

For Playlist:  <br>
(3)  Loading a playlist from a text file, provided by other systems, into your system;    <br>
(4)  Displaying a playlist with the information such as the name of the playlist, all the tracks in this playlist, their album, artist  and duration, and the total duration of the playlist.    <br>
(5)  Being able to make a new playlist by selecting tracks from the available tracks in your album collections and/or existing  playlists, and then save the new playlist with a new name into a chosen folder.  <br>

For Playing Music in MP3 format:   <br>
(6) Providing an interface:  <br>
